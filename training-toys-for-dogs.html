                                    Dogs and humans have been together from the beginning of time. Dogs have evolved themselves to fill various roles, watchdogs, guard dogs, now police dogs and sniffers. However, they need to be trained to do anything. The earlier you start the training,
                                    the better trained they become. So, how to train a dog? Let's find out in this dog training guide.</p>


                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    As an organisation, we believe that a trained dog is what you would call an educated dog. There is nothing mightier than a well trained and behaved dog. There are many benefits to training your dog; some of them will honestly save your life.
                                </p>
                                <h4>1. It makes your dog's life significantly safer.</h4>
                                <div class="feature-img">
                                    <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/blog/dogm.jpg" alt="">
                                </div>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    As a pet parent, you are always worried about your dog's safety. And, as a parent, it is your responsibility to ensure they are safe at all times. But, dogs being dogs, they are always getting into trouble. But, a well-trained dog obeys your commands
                                    and stays out of trouble. You do not have to be worried about your running into the streets and getting in front of a car or getting into hazardous situations.
                                </p>

                                <h4>2. Your house is safe:</h4>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    We have heard about dogs that destroy the entire house when you leave them alone, even for a while. This is not safe for your dog as well as those in the house. Training your dog will ensure that your living areas are secure and treated with respect.
                                    You will have to train your dog from the very start and instil manners and teach them what is acceptable in the house and what is not.</p>


                                <h4>3. It makes your dog a lot more social and friendly:</h4>

                                    A training plan will establish a good relationship between you and your pet. The time you spent together training, shared experiences and setting boundaries will mean a long and healthy relationship between you and your dog. During training, your dog
                                    will learn to trust you and obey your commands, thus building towards your relationship. Role of dog training toys in training your dog Training your dog requires time and consistency. Dog training toys can help make
                                    training easier and also assist in teaching a few tricks. PawsIndia has worked on curating training toys to help your dog become the BEST BOY at every park! These tried and tested training toys can be the solution to

                                <h3>Training</h3>
                                <h4>1. Chewing Training:</h4>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    Trust us, you do not want a puppy who chews on your furniture and rugs for a year until they are teething. It is important to train your puppy right from the first time they start chewing. You can very easily train your puppy using dental toys. Dental
                                    toys are designed to satisfy your dogs chewing and teething needs. They are safe, and good for your dog’s jaw. Training Tip: Every time your puppy or dog chews on something they aren’t supposed to, give them the chew
                                    toy and indicate that instead of chewing on that, chew on this. If your puppy finds it difficult to understand, just add a treat or some peanut butter over the toy to attract them. This way, your puppy will be rewarded
                                    every time they chew on the toy and thus develop a habit to chew on it.
                                </p>

                                <h4>2. Fetch Training:</h4>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    TPlaying fetch is a great way for your furry friend to get some exercise and playtime. In fact, it is also a great way for you and your dog to strengthen your bond. Fetch training can be made a huge success in multiple ways. The idea is to get your dog
                                    excited about the object you are throwing just enough to chase after it and enjoy the thrill of chasing it. When they enjoy it, they will bring back the toy to you for you to throw it again. Training Tip: During the
                                    training, if your dog gets disinterested and forgets to bring the toy back, do not bring it back yourself. Get your dog excited about the toy and let them take it back, this way they understand that they always have
                                    to get it back, no matter what. Fetch toys can make this training easier by enticing the dog and reducing your effort in doing so. These fetch toys are interactive, which means they respond to your dog’s energy. This
                                    means if your dog is super excited, it will respond in the same way. If your dog is disinterested, they will make fun squeaky sounds or jump to entice your dog to play. These toys work very well during training and
                                    your dog also loves the excitement and energy release. <br>The magic of magic roller! <br>The magic roller is an interactive and self-play toy by PawsIndia. The toy is perfect for

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    Let’s be honest, urban pet parents cannot spend all day with their dogs. They constantly have to juggle between things which leaves your pet alone for long hours. The only way for you to be able to keep your dog alone at home unsupervised would be by

                                    Puppies are so curious! And they have occasional energy bursts that makes them run all around the house, bite on stuff and chew. The toy is great for crate training for your curious little puppy. This toy will keep your dog company and entertain them
                                    even in small spaces and thus your puppy won't be bored all by themselves. Anxiety relief training: You do know what your puppy has been through before they got adopted. A lot of adopted dogs go through traumatic experiences
                                    before they find a loving and safe home. Anxiety is, although common, goes undetected. This toy helps dogs with abandonment issues by keeping them company and engaged while you are away. Because, let's be honest, you
                                    cannot stay with your dog 24 hours a day!

                                <b>Tips on how to train a puppy</b> and effective ways to make training fun, and <b>best ways to house train a dog</b>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    There is nothing wrong with wondering whether your puppy enjoys their training. Here are a few ways to ensure some training time fun for your dog:
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    1. Reward your dog: Dogs do not understand what you say, but they try to understand your actions and emotions. When your dog does something right, rewarding them with a treat tells them that their behaviour is rewarded. Every dog loves some treats; this
                                    makes training fun for them.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    2. Hold the training at different places: A change of scene can help make the exercise more effective. This means that no matter what situation, your dog will obey your commands. This can be fun for your dog as they get to explore different places, which
                                    work out great considering their inquisitive nature.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    3. Switch up the training frequently: Repetitive training routine can get dull and predictive. Find ways to make the same training exciting every time.
                                </p>
